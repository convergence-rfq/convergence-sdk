Definitions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. 

A "Licensed Work" includes any means that is protectable under applicable copyright law, including unmodified code or a work based on the code.

To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.

This License also requires that such uses provide notice of the original source of the Licensed Work as well as the continuing applicability of this License. The Licensor may make additional use grants for certain commercial and/or production use of the Licensed Work on a case-by-case basis by providing or publishing such permission in writing. 
The Licensor also grants you the right to contribute to the Licensed Work by modifying it so long as such modifications are non-commercial and on a non-production basis, so long as the modifications are made publicly available for audit, with notice provided of the original source as well as the continuing applicability of this License. Except as specifically stated herein, the Licensor does not grant you the right to modify or create derivative works for any purpose without written permission from the Licensor.

To the extent any such use is permitted, this License must continue to apply to any of the Licensed Work that is utilized. For example, where a portion of code is permitted to be utilized and modified to become part of a larger work, this License shall still apply to the portion of the code that has been modified. This license must be made available with the code, and the larger work must include a notice stating the original source of the code, and that it is released under and still subject to this license.
